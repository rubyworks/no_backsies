= Inherited

Given a class that defines a no-backsies +inherited+ callback.

  class Y
    include NoBacksies::Callbacks

    def self.list
      @list ||= []
    end

    callback :inherited do |base|
      list << base
    end
  end

  z = Class.new(Y)

Then the results are as follows.

  Y.list #=> [z]
