= Basic Example

First require the 'nobacksies' library.

  require 'nobacksies'

Include the Callbacks module in a class and define
a callback procedure.

  class Y
    include NoBacksies::Callbacks

    def self.list
      @list ||= []
    end

    callback :method_added do |method|
      list << method
    end

    def foo; end
    def bar; end
  end

We can see that +list+ holds the methods added.

  Y.list.assert == [:foo, :bar]
