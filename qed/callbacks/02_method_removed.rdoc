== Method Removed

Given a class that defines a no-backsies +method_removed+ callback.

  class Y
    include NoBacksies::Callbacks

    def self.list
      @list ||= []
    end

    callback :method_removed do |method|
      list << method
    end

    def foo; end
    def bar; end

    remove_method(:foo)
    remove_method(:bar)
  end

Then the results are as follows.

  Y.list #=> [:foo, :bar]
