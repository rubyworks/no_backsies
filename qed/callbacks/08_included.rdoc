= Included

Given a class that defines a no-backsies +included+ callback.

  module U
    include NoBacksies::Callbacks

    def self.list
      @list ||= []
    end

    callback :included do |mod|
      list << mod
    end
  end

  class X
    include U
  end

  class Y
    include U
  end

Then the results are as follows.

  U.list #=> [X, Y]
