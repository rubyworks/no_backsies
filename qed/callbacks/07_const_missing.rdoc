= Constant Missing

Given a class that defines a no-backsies +const_missing+ callback.

  class Y
    include NoBacksies::Callbacks

    def self.list
      @list ||= []
    end

    callback :const_missing, :superless=>true do |const|
      list << const
    end

    FOO
    BAR

  end

Then the results are as follows.

  Y.list #=> [:FOO, :BAR]

Notice we used `:superless` to prevent super from being called, which would
have raised an NameError.
