== Singleton Method Added

Given a class that defines a no-backsies +singleton_method_added+ callback.

  class Y
    include NoBacksies::Callbacks

    def self.list
      @list ||= []
    end

    callback :singleton_method_added do |method|
      list << method
    end

    def self.foo; end
    def self.bar; end
  end

Then the results are as follows.

  Y.list #=> [:foo, :bar]
